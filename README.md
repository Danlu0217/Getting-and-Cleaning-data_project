This folder is about the project on "Getting and cleaning data" course 

---------------------
This repo includes four files, the "run_analysis.R" script is made of code that merges two data sets(test and train) on the condition that the measurements that involved in "mean" function and "standard deviation" function. The second file, "secondRscript" is a script that generates a table with the first column being the mean of each column (or variable) from the new merged table obtained from "run_analysis" code, the second column/variable from this file is the name of the feature/variable function that was applied. The third file, is a "README" file, which contains information on the instructions of all the files in this folder. The fourth file, CodeBook, is a text file illustrating the variables involved.
---------------------
Mean functions appeared from column 1-column 33; Std functions appeared from column 34- column 66 in the "run_analysis.R" script, column 67 is a description for different activities. Labels were obtained from "features" text file and have been added into "newtable1", which is the table obtained from "run_analysis.R". The activity name for each measurement was shown on the far right column, with the variable name "actname"
